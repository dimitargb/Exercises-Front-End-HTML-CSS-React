Whenever we neeed something to change in the user interface we need to change the state.
To create new state we need to do it on the top level of our function.
State is necessary whenever we want to udate somethin on the screen !!!

That's why we use useState 
Second we use useEffect

const [advice, setAdvice] = useState("");

And we import it on top:
import { useState } from "react";

React is a library, not a framework.

React keeps the userItreface in sync with the state, that's why it is so important!!!

React is a component-based, state-driven JS Library for building users interfaces !!!

React is all about components such as: buttons, input fileds, searchBars and ect.
Components are the building blocks of the userintrfaces in React!!!
What React is basiccaly take components and drow them on the webPage!!!
We can reuse components again and again!!

In order to describe each component and how it works we use a special declerative syntax - JSX!!!
With this we tell React what will have to happend when some data chages but not how to do it using JSX!!

JSX is a syntax that combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as referencing other components.

Main goal of React is always to keep the UI(user intrface)in sync witnh the data.
Here comes the Sate. React is state - driven.

REACT REACTS TO STATE CHANGES BY RE-RENDERING THE UI !!!

1. React is really good on rendering components on a webpage(UI), based ont their current state.
2. React is really good in keeping the UI in sync with the state, by re-rendering(reacting) when the state of the components  chages  .
