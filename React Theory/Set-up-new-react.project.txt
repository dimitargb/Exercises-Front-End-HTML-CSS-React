There are 2 options:

1. Create-React-App tool - comes automatically with developer server, module binding with Jest testing Library
    The problem with this app is that was developed many years ago and uses old and slow tehnologies under the hood;
    That's why is used just for learning and small projects.


2. Vite tool - is used to build real world application.
    This is a modern build tool that contains a template for for seting up React applications.
    Here we have to manually set up many very important developer tools such as ESLint, testing library and others.
    With Vite the pages will update almost instantly, very vaey fast.

To buld new Projects we need to use React Framework such as NEXT.js or Remix !!!

Framework like NEXT.js contains solutions for things like routing, data fatching and server-side rendering !!!
React Framework is a framework build on top of the React library which makes easyer to build applications!
