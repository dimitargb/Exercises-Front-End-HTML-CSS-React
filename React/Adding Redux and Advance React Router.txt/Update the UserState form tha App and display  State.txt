How we update the state inside Redux?
We udate the State by dispatching an action to our Reducer.
We do that by using the action creater that was automatically created by createSlice function.

This is done in the CreateUser Element  in the submit form, as sonn as we click on StartOrdering button.


We will update the Redux Store in the handleSubmit function when we click the button in the CreateUser Element.
We get access to dispatch function by using the useDipatch hook provided by React Redux.
We use the an action creater function from createSlice.js -> updateName(username).
And what we need to pass in this function is the username.

Now we need to redirect to the menu.
For that we need the navigate function which we got from useNavigate(), part of React Router.

We read data from Redux store with the useSelector hook -> const username = useSelector(state=>state.user.username);
