Creating a Thunk Middlewear by using the build in createAsyncThunk function.
The idea is to implement the feature where aour users can use Geolocation, in order to get their GPS position.
and their address.

Let's open up the userSlice.js now.

The Thunk is a Middlewear that sits between dispatching and the reducer. So it will do somthing to the dispatch action, 
before updating the store.
Now in order to create a Thunk we will use the createAsyncThunk function.

export const fetchAddress = createAsyncThunk('/user/fetchAddress', async function(){}
