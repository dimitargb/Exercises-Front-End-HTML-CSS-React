All we have to do here is we have to go to the cartSlice.js and use our reducer here:

 deleteItem(state, action){
            //payload = pizzaId
            state.cart = state.cart.filter(item=>item.pizzaId !== action.payload)
        },
What we have to do id to dispatch an action thatr is created by teh deleteItem action creater,
each time we click on the DELETE button.

We want the DELETE button not only in the cart but in the menuItem as well, so we can delete a pizza we ordered by mistake.
So it means we should creat a reausable Component here. So in the cart folder we add new file called DeleteItem.jsx

On the DeleteItem Button we will add onClick() prop, becouse is here where we want to disptach the dlete action,
which we get from useDispatch() from react-redux. 
And inside we need our actioncreateor which is the deleteItem.

function DeleteItem({pizzaId}) {
    const dispatch = useDispatch()
    return (
        <div>
            <Button type='small'  onClick={()=>dispatch(deleteItem())}>Delete</Button>
        </div>
    )
}

We also need to pass the pizzaId as a prop in the DeleteItem function.
In the CartItem we need to pass the pizzId prop as well.

To determine the quntity ofordered pizzas we need a useSelector(getCurrentQuantityById(id));
We need to bulid this Selector in the cartSlice.js

export const getCurrentQuantityById = (id) => (state) => state.cart.cart.find(item=>item.pizzaId === id) ?.quantity ?? 0;

The Selector Function is a function that returns another function.
