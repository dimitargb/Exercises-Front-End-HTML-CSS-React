We will show how to use Reduce Method with numbers.
If we want to read all the books in the array, and we want to know how many pages we will have to read
The solution is to add all together all of the pages proerties of all the books we use for that the Reduce Method.

The Reduce Method takes a callBack Function which will be executed for each element of the array, and as a second argument it 
alsow takes in a starter value in our case from 0.
The goal of reduce Method is to reduce the entire array to just one value.

const pagesOfAllBooks = books.reduce((acc, book) => acc + book.pages, 0); // acc - accumulator, 0 is a starterValue
console.log(pagesOfAllBooks); // 3327
