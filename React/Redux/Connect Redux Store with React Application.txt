To connect Redux store with React application we need to install onother package.

npm i react-redux

Only true this react-redux package can Redux and React application be connected.
We need to import from react-redux package the Provider in index.js

And now we can wrap our entire application in that provider.
And here we need to pass the store prop.

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);

Now we have successfuly connected Redux with React!

In order to read to read data from Redux store we need to use useSelector Hook provider by Redux.
This useSelector Hook is a callback function that uses store.

In React we get access to the dispatch function by using the useDispatch Hook.
