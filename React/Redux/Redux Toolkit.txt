The modern way of writing Redux is Redux Toolkit.
Redux Toolkit allows us to write a lot less code to achieve the best results.

1. Allows us to write code taht mutetes state inside reducers.
2. Redux Toolkit automatically creats action creaters from our reducers.
3. Redux Toolkit will automatically setup middlewear and Redux DevTools.

First we need to intall Redux Toolkit:
npm i @reduxjs/toolkit

Now we use the configureStore method intead the createStore in the store.

import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

The configureStore function wrapps around createStore and adds a few functionalities to it.
It will aotomtically combine our Reducers, it will automatically add the thunk middlewear and set up the Dev Tools.

const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
        account: accountReducer,
        customer: customerReducer,
    }
})

Another function we can import form Redux Toolkit is createSlice();
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
createSlice() Function gives us 3 benefits:
1. It will automatically create action creators from our Reducers.
2. We can mutate our state inside Reducers( this is the biggest advantage of using Redux Toolkit).
