Four criteria for splitting the UI into components:

1. Logical separation of the content/ layout.

2. We have to try to make some of this componens reusable.

3. Ensure that each component has single well defined responsability.

4. Creating components according your personal coding style.

Start with relatively big component and then split into smaller components as it is necessary.
