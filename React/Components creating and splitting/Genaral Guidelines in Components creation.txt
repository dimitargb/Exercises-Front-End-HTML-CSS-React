1. Creating a new component, creats a new abstraction. More abstractions require more mental energy.
    So try not to create new components to early.

2. Name a component accordint to what it does or waht it displays.

3. Never declare a new component inside onother component!!!

4. Co-locate related components inside the same file.

5. It is completely normal that an application has components of different sizes(small and big ones).

Small components are highly reusible and have vaey low complexity, which sometimes is exactely what we need.
The Big Components are not ment to be reused!
