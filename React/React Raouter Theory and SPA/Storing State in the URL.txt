1. Placing Sate in the URL is an easy way to store Sate in the Global place, that is easyly accessible from all components.
   If we place Sate in the URL we can easyely read a value from there. So basically we can move some 
   State Managment from React to URL.
2. Placing State in the URL is a good way to pass data from one page into the next page, without having to store taht 
   data in some temporaly place.

3. Placing State in the URL makes it possible to bookmark and share the page with the exact UI state it
   had at that time.

   For storing State in the URL we use params or query string!!!
   Params is very useful to pass data to the next page, while the qerry string is usefull to store some
   global state that should be acessable very where.

   To use Params with React Raouter we do it in 3 steps: 1. We create a new Route, 2. We link to that Route
   and 3. in thet Route we read the State from the URL.

   <Route path="cities/:id" element={<City />} />
   on the CityItem component -> <Link className={styles.cityItem} to={`${id}`}>
   Then we use useParams() hook on City Item
