Once the server sends a huge (JS file to the client) that is requesting it and this file is the Bundle.
The Bandle is a JS file that contains the entire code of the application.
Once the code was doawnload the entire React application is loaded at once, that turns it into SPA.
The Bundle Size is the aount of JS code that every single user needs to doawnload in order to start
using the application. There for the Bundle Size is the most important thing that we need to optimize.
In order to do that we use a technique called code splitting. This takes the Bandle and splits it into
multiple parts. 
So intead a huge JS file we will have multiple smaller files which will be doawnloaded over time 
as they become necessary for the application.
This process of loading files sequensually is called lazy loading. 

The most common way is to split the Bundle into the Route level(at the page level).
What we do is to take all the components taht represent  a page and load each of them separately.

With the lazy loading we will load the Route elements as we need them.

Exsample:

const Homepage = lazy(() => import("./pages/Homepage"));
const Product = lazy(() => import("./pages/Product"));
const Pricing = lazy(() => import("./pages/Pricing"));
const Login = lazy(() => import("./pages/Login"));
const AppLayout = lazy(() => import("./pages/AppLayout"));
const PageNotFound = lazy(() => import("./pages/PageNotFound"));

Now we need Suspense
Suspense is part of modern React and allous some components to suspend(allos them to wait something to happend).
