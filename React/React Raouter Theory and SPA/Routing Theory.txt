When we use Routing we match diffrent URL to diffrent Views in User intrface.
In React we match each URL to a specific React Component.
This enables users to navigate between diffrent screens of the Application by using links and URL in the brouser.
This keeps the UI in sync with the current brouser URL.
This only works this way on the client side.

In React routing is usually handeled by the package RactRouter.
This is the most important and mosed used React Third party Library out there.

Routing is fundametnal to build SPA(Single Page Applications).
The SPA are Applications executed entierly on the client(only in the users web-brouser).
Whenever a user clicks om a special link provided by the router the URL in the brouser simply chanages.
In React this job is done by ReactRouter.
Changing the URL will trigger the DOM to be updated as a result. In SPA javascript will udate the DOM and page.
Which means there will be never a complete page reload.
The entire App in just one page, without any realoads.

Whenever the URL is changed ReactRouter and React itself will update the DOM by simply rendering the Component that
corresponds to the new URL. The whole cilce can be repated as many times as necessary, all without reloading the page!!!

When we want to create a react routin we open new Terminal.

npm i react-router-dom@6 We define our Routs in a declatirve ways.
-> import { BrouserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return <BrouserRouter>
  </BrouserRouter>;
}
