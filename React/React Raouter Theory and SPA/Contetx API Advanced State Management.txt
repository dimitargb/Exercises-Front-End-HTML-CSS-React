Context API gives a solution to prop drilling.

Context API is a system to pass data trought the application, without menually pass props down the component tree.
1. The first part ot the Context API is the Provider.

2.Provider gives the all child components access to a Value. It can be anywhere ont he component tree but is common to
place it at the top.
This value is the data that we want to make available thrue the Provider.
So we pass this value into the Provider.
3.Finally we have Consumers which are all the components that read the value that we passed into the Provider.

But what happends when the value gets updated and chanages. Whenever the Context value is updated, all Consumers will be
re-rendered as long as that component is subscribed to that exact Context!!!

1. We create a new Context:
  createContext() - function part of React; We can pass in a default value for this context, but we usually never do that.
  Because that value can not change over time. Intead we usually pass null or leave it empty!!!

  const PostContext = createContext() -> PostContext is a Component;
  Now we can pass the value into the Context Proider.

  After this <PostContext.Provider> - Now we need to pass the value into this Provider!!!
  <PostContext.Provider value={{}}> in the value we need an object which will contain al the data taht we want to make
  accessable to the child Components !!!

    <PostContext.Provider value={{
      posts: searchedPosts,
      onAddPost: handleAddPost,
      onClearPosts: handleClearPosts,
      searchQuery,
      setSearchQuery,
      }}>
Now lets consume the Context value in multiple Components and get rid of all the annoying props!!!
