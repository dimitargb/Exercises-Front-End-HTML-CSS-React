The first step is to set up a gitHub repository woht our Project files. We write git add -A
Than git commit -m 'Initial comit'
Than we create a new Reposotory. than from the new page that appears we compy the last part and paste it to the powershel of the
visual studio code and press enter. All the files should be now in the new Repository.

Now we can move on and connect this Repository to Versel at versel.com
