The Metadata -> here for exsample the metadata is the title on the page:

export const metadata = {
  title: "The Wild Oasis",
};

But we can export Metadata from each individual Page, which will overwrite the metadat from the payout.
Lets go to Cabins Page. And we write this meadata function:

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Cabins'
}

We can write it this way:
export const metadata = {
  //title: "The Wild Oasis",
  title: {
    template:'%s / The Wild Oasis',
    default:'Wellcome/ The Wild Oasis'
  },
  description: 'Luxurious cabin hotel, located in the heart of the Italian Dolomites, surrounded by beautiful mountains and forests'
};

The Favicon is the icon that appears on top of the page naext to the URL.

What we do we copy the logo.png, than paste it in the app folder. We need to call it icon.png, not logo.png beacouse 
this is an Next JS convention. And now we can see the picture on top of the internet page.
