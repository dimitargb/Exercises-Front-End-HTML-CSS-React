In order to do that we use a new hook called useFormStatus();
This hook must be used ib a Component that is rendered inside a Form, not in the Component that contins the Form.
Because the element where we want to diplay this From status is the Update profile button, lets create a new Button
for calling this hook.

We create a new Function called Button and inside we use the useFormStatus hook and inside we conditionally render the text.

Besically we need to create a new Component, that needs to be rendered inside the Form.
Since useFormStatus() is a react dom hook, the Button function that we created needs to be a Client Component, but we 
alreday have the 'use client' directive at the top, so all the Component in there will be Client Components.

We need to make it clear, theta the Button function needs to be a Client Component in order to work.
