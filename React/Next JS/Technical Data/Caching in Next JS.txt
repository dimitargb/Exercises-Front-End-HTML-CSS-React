Caching means taking Data that has been fetched or copmuted and storing it in a temporaly location for future access.
This way when we need the same Data again in the future we can just takin it from the Cache insted of re-fetching it
or re-computing it every time the Data is needed again.

Everything that can be cached will be cached by Next JS.
Caching is allways on by default in Next JS App, which can lead to a pagr to display Data that has not been updated to thr client.
Many diffrent API' s affect and controll caching, it can be really difiicult, especaially for beginners.

Caching Mechanisms in Next JS.
There are 4 Caching Mechanisms, 3 of wich cach(store) Data on the Server:

1. Request Memoization - Data is cached and reused only diring exactely one Page render(this only works in React Component Tree).
2. Data Catche - stores all the Data in a specific Route or a single fetch request. Data is available for diffrent users.
3. Full Route Cache - building a Routes and storin them as a static Pages in a form of HTML at buildtime.
4. Router Cahce - Client Side Cache - this is used t store in the Brouser all the pre-fetched Pages static and dynamic.
