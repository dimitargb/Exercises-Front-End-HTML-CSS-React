We alreday exported the signOut function in the auth.js.
So lets' now create a simular serveraction tot he one we created for the signIn Page.
We go to action.js and create export async function signOut();

export async function signOutAction() {
  await signOut({ redirectTo: "/" });
}
So whenever the user signes out he wil be redirected to the Home page.
Next what we have to do is to connect theis function with the SignOutButton Component.
The SignOutButton is part of the SideNavigation.js. The SideNavigation is a Client Component meaning that 
the SignOut Component will be also be a Client Component. What we do is to wrap the SignOutButton function into
a form and we give it an action <form action={signOutAction}> 

The Server action can be called on the Client, but they can still be executed on the Server.

Now what we have to do is to somwhow connect those authenticated users in this application with the guetst form
our supabase Database.
