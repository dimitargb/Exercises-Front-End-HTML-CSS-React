We delete an Reservation by creating a Server Action in action.js and we creater a function 
export async function deleteReservation(bookingId). 
so we need to use 'use client' directive in the DeleteReservation.js Component.
We put the onClick={} in the button.
When we do some Server Action than we want the result of thet action to be reflected in the UI, all we do is to 
refetch the Data. So we clear the cache, get the fresh Data and that fresh Data will be rendered on the Page.

So what we do is to revalidate the cache.
