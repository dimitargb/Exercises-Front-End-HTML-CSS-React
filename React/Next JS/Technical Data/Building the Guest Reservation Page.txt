In odrer to do this we go to account > reservations. What we need to do is to fetch all the Reservations made by the guest.
For that we have a function in the data-service called getBookings().

So what we do we call the getBookings() in the export default function Page() form reservations page.js instead of the 
empty array.
Than we go to the ReservationCasrd and we replase img with Image form next/image.
