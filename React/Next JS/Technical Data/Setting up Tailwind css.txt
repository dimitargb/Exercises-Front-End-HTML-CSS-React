What we need to do is to import the globlas.scc files. So we go to the layout.js where is the code that wraps our 
entire Application. Here is the perfect place to import the scc files.

import '@/app/_styles/globals.css';

Now let's add some scc in the body.
<body className="bg-blue-800"> as an exsample.

Next we copy the code from colors.json{} and we go to tailwind.config.mjs and in the theme -> extend we paste the colors.
Now we can use those colors in our Application(primary, accent).

We also want to install icon labrary, which comes from Tailwind:

npm i @heroicons/react
