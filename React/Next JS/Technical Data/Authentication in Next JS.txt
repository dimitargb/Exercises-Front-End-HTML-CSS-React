For the auhtentication in Next Js we are goint to use the Library Auth JS wihc makes it easyer to integrate
authentication into an application. This Library is going to make it easyer to connect to many diffrent libraries as a Google, Facebook
GitHub and many others.
We are going to use Google.
So we create a new file in our lib called auth.Js

Before we write any code we need to set up a view enviorment veriables. So we go to .env.local and we difine NEXTAUTH_URL.

NEXTAUTH_URL = here you need to provide the URL the app is running on. This is: http://localhost:3000/.
After this we need to define NEXTAUTH_SECRET

NEXTAUTH_SECRET = 
Here we need to generate some Secret. 
We can use generate secret from vrsel in the intrenet - https://generate-secret.vercel.app/48;
710cd099be2b2cc4d5fc938fe3e36da0d745a1db78804944

After this we need to configure Google to accept logins for our application.
We type Google developer Console and here we need to create a new app.

We start by Creat Project - is called -> the wild oasis website.
On the left site of the created project we go to OAuth consent screen. Here we select External then Create.
Than here you type the website name - The Wild Oasis Web Site.
Than user supported e-mail : dimitardamianov2012@gmail.com and than save. Than save and continue.
On the next page we can add ourself on the list - dimitardamianov@yahoo.com -> for now just this user can test the app.

Than back to dashboard. Than later in some point we use the PUBLISH APP Button to move from testing to public application.

Than we go to Credencials. We need to press the button on top + CREATE CREDETIALS and press OAuth client ID.
Tnan on the application type we use Web application and in Authorized JavaScript origins we need to add some URL by
pressing ADD URI-> The first one is : http://localhost:3000 and than 
Authorized redirect URIs: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google than we press CREATE.
Than we copy the Client ID and paste it to AUTH_GOOGLE_ID in teh .env.local file.
And than AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET we copy the client secret and paste it there.
So with tis we are dont for now, later when we publish the app to production we will add those new URL.

Now we need to install the AUTH JS Library -> npm install next-auth@beta
