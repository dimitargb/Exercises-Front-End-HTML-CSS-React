What we need to do is to connect a logged in user with certain guets profile in our supabase Database.
How will we store in our Database for exsample in Reservations who actually made the reservation.
What we need is the guest table form our supabse Database.
We need a way to connect that guets that just logged in our app with the profile in guest tbale in our supabase Database.

Whenever a guest signes in we need to check if there is alerady a guest with that id int the guest table in our
supabase Database and if this exsist we store that info in the session and than from than on our application
knows the guest that has been logged in. If there is not any guest with that id in the guest tbale, than we create a new one.

To do that we can specify another callback in the auth.js called signIn.

For thatwe alreaedy have a function int the data-service called getGuest()
if there is no exsistin guser we want to create a new guest, we have a function in the data-servise called createGuest(),
where we pass in an Object newGuest();

We need to add to auth.js another callback called session callback.
