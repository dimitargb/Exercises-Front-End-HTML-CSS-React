Now inside app we create a folder called cabins. Inside this folder we crate a JS file called by convention page.js.
We write the export default function Page().
This is actually a React Server Component. Whatever JS code we write here will be Server Side Rendered.

export default function Page() {
    return <h1>Cabins Page</h1>
}

That's all we have to do to set up a new page!
If we want to create longer URL's with multiple segemnts we add another folder to cabins folder and inside we create test.js file

export default function Test() {
    return <h1>Test Page</h1>;
  }
This was just an example.

Now we create the about route by creating abou folder and account route.
