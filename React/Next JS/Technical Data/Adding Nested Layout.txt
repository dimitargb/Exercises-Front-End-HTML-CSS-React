We going to add a site Navigation to all our Routes in the Account area.
Basically what we want is a layout that stays on the page for all the raouts on the Account Page.

layout.js is the Route layout becaouse it does apply to the entire site.
If we want to add a nested layout to just one part of the site, for one URL segment, all we have to do is to create another
layout.js wright inside that Folder. In this particular case in the Account Folder.

In order to get into the layout of the nasted pages as resrvations and profile we use teh React {children} prop into the function.

export default function Layout({children}) {
    return <div className="grid grid-cols-[16rem_1fr] h-full gap-12">
            <div>Navigation</div>
            <div>{children}</div>
           </div>
}

Afetr that we need to get the SideNavigation and SignInButton from starter folder and put them into _components Folder.
And all what we have to do is to import the SideNavigation.js into the layout.js

The SignOutButton.js Component from the starter Folder also needs to go to _components Folder.
