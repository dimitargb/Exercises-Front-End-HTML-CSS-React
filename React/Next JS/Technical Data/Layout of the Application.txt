Each Next JS or any website needs to have one global layout, which we call the Route layout.
So we go to layout.js and delete all the cone inside. 
And we write:

export default function Root() {
  
}

This layout here will actually wrap the entire Application, there for it needs to conatin the HTML and the body Tag.
What is returning from this Root layout component this is displayed on all the Pages.
So how we get the Content of each Page into our layout. Here we use the concept of the Children prop.
We use the children prop to show the text in the other Components.

So int the layout.js we write:

export  const metadata = {
  title: 'The Wild Oasis',
}

export default function Root({children}) {
   return <html lang='en'>
    <body>
      <Navigation/>
      <main>
        {children}
      </main>
    </body>
   </html>
}

If we add footer under body, the text inside will appear in every single Page.
We also can export some Page meta Data form this layout. We mean something like the Pages Title.

With the metadata we change the Title name on top of the page.

One more thing to add on the layout is the Logo. What we do is to create a Logo Component in the components folder.
Than in the lyout.js we add hearer and inside we put the Logo and Navigation. In the Logo Component we must specify 
the path of the logo picture -> img src="/logo.png".
This layout is something that we call Server Components.
