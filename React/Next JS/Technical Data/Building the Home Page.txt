To do that we go to our Homepage wich is the page.js in the app Folder.
We have a premade Component in starter folder called home-page.js 
So we replace our page .js with home-page.js

We reaplae the img with Image Component from next.js
We also statically import the image:

import Image from "next/image";
import bg from '@/public/bg.png'

Instead of specify the hight and with we can just use fill.
This fills up the etire Element, the entire picture.
And we use the object fit set to cover:

fill className="object-cover"
We can put oject-top and the image always staarts from the top.
We can put an placholder and here we can specify 'blur'.
placeholder="blur", this only works with images that are statically imported.
Next we specify the quality{80}
