We are going to add one subroute to trh account page for reservations and one for the profile.
In order to create this nested Route we have to create a nested folder into accont folder called reservations and another one
called profile  !!!
Those folders need to get page.js files so they become routeable!!!
We get those two pages from our starter folder.
It has to be only page.js by convention, not other name!!!
We also add the ReservationCard component to the _components folder.
We have to install date-fns -> npm i date-fns;

We also copy the h2 Tag form resrvations page and replace the h1 Tad in account Folder.
And we write Wellcome 'username'.
