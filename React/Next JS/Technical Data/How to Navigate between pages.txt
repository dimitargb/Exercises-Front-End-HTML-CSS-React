What we have to do is to add a link in the Homepage that will link to our cabins Page.
We put everything in a <div></div>
Next JS provides us with the Link Component.

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
    <h1>The Wild Oasis. Wellcome to paradise</h1>
    <Link href="/cabins">Explore luxury cabins</Link>
    </div>
  )
}

Next JS also provides us with some Hooks for programatic Navigation.

Lets create a Components Folder to create a reusable Component for Navigation.
And inside we create a Component Navigation.js. After we go to our Homepage and import this Component.

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
    <h1>The Wild Oasis. Wellcome to paradise</h1>
    <Navigation/>
    <Link href="/cabins">Explore luxury cabins</Link>
    </div>
  )
}
We want Navigation in all the pages, so we go to the other pages and import the Navigation Component as well in a div.
