Now we go to the Cabins Page in cabins Folder called page.js.
Now we go to starter Folderand we find cabins-page.js in the pages Folder.

We copy the entire function and replace it with the Cabins Page.
We should as well add a CabinCard from starter file as well.
We add this to our _components Folder.

Thsi is now the Cabins Page. Now we move to the About Page.
Now we take the code for the About page from starter Folder.
We take the fiel about-page.js from starter Folder.
And we replace the function in the about page.
We replace the img with the Image Copmonent.
We need statically to import the images.

On the second Image we are loading image from somewhere else and we dont want to specify the with and high 
properties, beacouse it should be fluid responsive image, so instead we say 'fill'.
It fills the etire Page. Tha's why this image needs to be inside a container and we than specify the size of the container and
make this image fit inside using object-fit set to cover.
So first se set the div to relative. Than in the Image we set className = 'obeject-cover'.
And we need to give tha parent <div> a size. So we put aspect-square which will set the aspect retio to one.

So if we have a pic that we dont want to give dimantions, we palce those dimantions into the parent, in our case <div/>
In our case using the aspect-square or aspect-ratio and className = 'obeject-cover'  inside the Image. We can use also somewhere
other sixe here - aspect-video and others. Thuis way the image stays still responsive.

Finally lets specify the placeholder set to blur but in the first image only.
