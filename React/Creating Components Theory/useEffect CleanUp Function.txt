This is a cleanUp Function from the Effect!!! In our application this is a function that sets the title in our Application
back to the default one - usePopcorn.

The Clean UP Function is a function that we can return from an effect(optional)
This function will run on 2 occasions:
 1. Before the effect is executed again.
 2. After a component instance has unmounted.

We need the Clean up function whenever the side effect keeps happenign after the component has re-rendered or unmounted!

Each effect should only do one thing!!!
So if you need to create multiple effects in your components, use mulitple useEffect hooks.

useEffect(
    function () {
      if (!title) return;
      document.title = `Movie | ${title}`;

      return function () {
        document.title = "usePopcorn"; -> this is a CleanUp Function
      };
    },
    [title]
  );
