1. Presentaional Components(Stateless Components)- no State, can recieve props. This a usually small Components
   and reusable Componets such as Logo, NumResult, Movie in out app.

2. Steful Components - this are Components that have State. They can be still reusable - Search Component in our app.

3. Structural Components - this are pages, layouts or screens of the application. Thay can be big and not reusable.
