Component is what we write in order to descripe a piece of User Interface.
Component is a JS function that returns React Elements!!!
We write theis Elements using the JSX syntax!!!

The Component is a Template. From this Template React creats one or multiple component instances!!!
Reacts does this each time we use this component somewhere in our code. For Example:

<Tab num={0} activeTab={activeTab} onClick={setActiveTab} />
<Tab num={1} activeTab={activeTab} onClick={setActiveTab} />
<Tab num={2} activeTab={activeTab} onClick={setActiveTab} />

This are 3 instances of Tab in our component tree.
Each intance(Tab) that holds it's own state and props and has own lifecicle.

Each of the Instances will retun one or more React Elements !!!
React Element contains all the information necessary ot create DOM Elements for this instace.
This React Element will be converted to the actual DOM Element and painted ont the screen by the brouser!!!

The DOM Element is the final representation of the component's instnace in the brouser!!!

The React Elemnts are not directly rendered to the DOM. React Elements just live inside the React App,
and have nothing to do with the DOM. 
They are converted to DOM Elements when they are painted on the screen in the final step.

State chnages triggers rendering!!!
