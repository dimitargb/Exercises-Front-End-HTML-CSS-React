React Hooks are special functions bulid into React wich allow us to hook into Reacts internal mechanisms, 
such as creating and accsessing State form Fiber Tree, or registeribg sideeffects in the Fiber tree.
Using the useStete of useEffect Hook we can hook into the internal mechanism.

All Hooks start with the word use.
We can create our own cumstom hooks, which also start with the word use!!!
Custom Hooks give us an easy way of reusing a none-visiual logic(that is nto about the UI).

Hooks have 2 main rules:

1. They can be called only on the top level - We can not call hook inside conditions, loops
    nested functions aor eraly return.

2. Hooks can onlu be called from Reacr Functions -> They can obly be called form a function component 
    or a custom hooks.
