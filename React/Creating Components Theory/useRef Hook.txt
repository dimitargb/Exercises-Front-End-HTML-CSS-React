We use the use Ref Hook to create something called Ref.
Ref is like a box in wich we can put any data that we want to be preserved between renders.
When we use use Ref React will give us an object with a mutable curent property. And thean we can write
 any data into this current property. And read from it.

 1. We can create variables that will stay the same between renders.
 2. We can select and store DOM elements.

 Usually Ref only appear in eventhandlers or effects,but not in the JSX. We use Refs jsut for data
 that should be only remembred by the Component over time, but never re-rendered!
