The idea is to give us a place where we can safe write side effects.

Side effect is any interaction between a React component and the worls ouside that component.

We need Side Effects all the time when we build React apps.
Side Effects should not happend during the component render.
We cna create Side Effects in 2 ways:

1. In Event Handlers(triggred with onClick, onSubmit, ect). Sometimes only reacting to an event is not enough for 
    some applications.

2. By using useEffect() Hook(triggered by rendering). 
    Effetcs allow us to write code, that will run in different moments(mount, re-render or unmount).

Effects are only executed afetr the brouser has painted the component instance on the screen!
Effects run synchronasly after the render has alreday been painted to the screen. The reason is becouse,
effects may contain long running processes, such as fetching data. The effects do not run during render.

But the layOutEffect runs before the beouser paint.
We included the (query) variable in the depandancy array in the useEffect Hook.
Our useEffect Hook is (query) is like an event handler that is listening on an event to change.
