npm create vite@4(when creating own app - npm create vite@latest )
than it will ask you for the project name - fast-react-pizza.
thank use arrow keys to select react.
than select JavaScript
than we need to write npm install
than we need to cofigure eslint.
we write npm i eslint vite-plugin-eslint eslint-config-react app --save-dev,

than we add to the fast-reatc-pizza folder, .eslintrc.json
and we write in this folder - {
                                "extends":"react-app"
                                }
And we than need to import something in viteconfig.js
import eslint from'vite-plugin-eslint';
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), eslint()],
})

With this we should have correctly configured eslint in our project.
Than we open the src folder nad delete the App.css and index.css
and we delete the assets folder as well.
In the main.jsx file we remove the -> import './index.css'

And than we delete everything from App.jsx and we type rfc instead to use our ready made snipped.

And finally we type npm run dev.

Than we can start installing the Technologies:
npm i react-router-dom@6
