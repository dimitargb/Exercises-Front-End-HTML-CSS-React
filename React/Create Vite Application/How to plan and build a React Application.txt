1. Breaking the desired User Interface into Components.
2. Building a static version without state.
3. After this we think about state managemant and data flow.

In the more complex and real-world applications we need to start:

1. By gathering application requirements and features. And base on those.

2. Divide our application into multiple pages.
   - for each page we can think about the overall and page-level  UI.
   - than we can break the disired UI into its components.
   - design and build the static version(no state yet).

3. Than we need to place all the features into a few Categories.
     - think about state managemant and data flow.

4. Finally we need to dicide which libaries we want to use(technology decisions).
