Types fo State depending from the feature categories.

State Slices form Redux :  1. User -> Global UI State(no accounts) and needs to be accessibale from many diffrent components
                           2. Menu -> Global Remote State(menu is fetched form the API)
                           3. Cart-> Global UI State(no need for API, just stored in the application)
                           4. Order -> Global Remote State(fetched and submitted to API)



Technologies building the Application.

1. Routing -> ReactRouter (if you want to work with data fetching with ReactRouter you will need createBrowserRouter).
2. Styling -> tailwindcss
3. Remote State Management -> ReactRouter
4. UI State Management -> Redux


createBrowserRouter() is a function where we difine our routes and we do that by passing it an array of obejects
where is Object is one route.
