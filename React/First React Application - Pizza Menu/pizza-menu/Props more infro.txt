React renders a component based on it's current Data.
And the UI will always be capt in sync with that Data.

The Data React uses to render a component is mad of Propes and State !!!

Props can only be updated by the parent component iteself !

State can be updated by the component's logic iteself.

This means that props are immutable, they can not be changed and a read-only!!
If you need to mutate props, you need th change tha State.

Props are just an object, therefore if you change the pros object in the component, you will affect the Parent Component.
Side effect happend whenevr you change some Data that's located outside of the current function.

Components have to be pure Functions, this helps optimize app, avoid bugs ect.

So a component should never mutate any Data that we write outside it's function scope.

React uses One Way Data Flow !!!
It means in React applications, data can only be passes from Paernt to Child Component !!
This happends by using Props.
