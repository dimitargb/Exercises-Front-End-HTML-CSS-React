Componenets are the most fundamental concept in React.

React applicationas are entirly made of components.

Componenets are the building blocks of any user interface in React.
what React does is take components and drow them into the web page.

Each component has its own data, JS logig and appearance !!!

We build complex web sites by building multiple components and combining them!!!

We nest components inside each other !!!

Whenever we need some duplication in our UI(user-interface), we can create a new component and reuse it.

In React we have parents and child components. They are connnected together.

In React we write new Components using functions.
The function name need to be with upperCase Letter - function Pizza(), and second the function needs to return some markup!!!

function Pizza() {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src="pizzas/salamino.jpg" alt="Pizza salamino" />
      <h2>Pizza Salamino</h2>
      <p>Tomato, mozarella, and pepperoni</p>
    </div>
  );
}

The images have to be in a public folder to load formt there.
Each Component can only return exactely one element!!!
