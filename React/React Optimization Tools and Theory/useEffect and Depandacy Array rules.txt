1. Every single state varibale and prob that is being ued in the Effect must be included in the depandancy array.
    Any context value taht the Component has subcribed too must also be included in the depandancy array.
    All values that are somehow connected to state, props or context, are react values!
    All react values must be included as well:
    const [number, setNumber] = useState(5);
    const [duration, setDuration] = useState(0);
    those are react values.

2. The final rule is that we should not use objects or arrays as depandances!!!

Effects must be used only as a last reaort when no other solution makes sence.

When not to use an effect:

1. Use an effect to responde for userEvent like a click or a keyStroke, inseted use eventHandler Function!!!

2. Fetching data from API when the component first mounts, is fine to use for small apps 
   but in real word is best to use a proffesional data fetching Library like a React Query.

3. Effects are overused a lot to sinchronize stateChnages with one another. Try to use derived State 
   and eventHandlers intead.
