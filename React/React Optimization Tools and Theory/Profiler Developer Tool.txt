With the Profile Developer Tool we can analyze renders and re-renders. 

In the Profiler tool we need to go to settings, press
the blue circle Start Profiling. Than when we stop recording diffrent colors apprear. The gary comoiments are the ones that
did actually not render while the application rerenders, when for exsample we type somethig in  post search. In our case
Main, Post and App did not renrender. The more yellow the color is the longer it took to re-render. The Post Rprovider took 
the longest.
