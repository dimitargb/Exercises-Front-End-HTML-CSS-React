In order to stabiilize objects an Functions we use useMemo Hook.

In order to do this we use useMemo() with callBack function:

const archiveOptions = useMemo(() => {
    return {
      show:false,
       title:'Post archive in addition to main posts',
    };
  });

useMemo() takes in a callBack Function. The callBack Function will be staored in the memory(cached).
We also need to pass in the depandecy array, which will determine when this callculation will be executed again, like
the useEffect Hook.
If the depandecy array is empty it means that this value will only be computed once in the beginnign and will then never
change!
