1. Prevent waisted Renders.
we can use - memo, useMemmo and callBack Hook.
we can pass elements into other elemnts as children or a normal prob in order to prevent them of beeing re-rendered.

In React a component instance onaly gets re-rendered in 3 diffrent situations:

a. When the component State changes!
b. When there is a change in the context that the component is subscribed too!
c. When Parent Component is re-rendering!

Rendering a compoment does not mean that the DOM actually get updated.

A waisted Render is a render that did not produce any change in the DOM.

2. Improve overall application speed and responsivnes.
 to imrove the spped we can use we - useMemmo, callBack Hook and useTransition.


3. Reduce the bundle size.
  We can reduce the bundle sixe by using fewer 3-th party packages
  We can implement code splitting and lazy loading.
