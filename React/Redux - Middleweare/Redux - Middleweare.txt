How to make a async operation in Redux?
Those operations must happend ouside a reducer!

In Redux, Middleweare is a function that sits betweeen the dispatch and the store.
The Middleweare allows deveopers to run some code after dispatching an action, but before that action
reaches the reducer in the srore. With the Middleweare we can do some action before that action gets into the reducer.
That's hy the Middleweare is the perfect place for the async API call.

The Middleweare is the place where to put side effects in the Redux cicle.

In a case of async operation the most popular Middleweare operation is called Redux Thunk(third party package).

If we have the Redux Thunk Middleweare the action will no longer imidiately dispatched to the store, but will firat go into 
the Middleweare. So into the Thunk. Than we can start fetching some data inise the Thunk, but it can be some other
async operation.

Basically the Thunk allows Redux to wait before dispatching the fetched data into the store.

In order to use this Middleweare, we need to install the package, apply it to our store and use in in action functions.

npm i redux-thunk;

in the createStore function in store.js we pass the applayMiddleweare:
and in the applyMiddleware we pass the thunk
const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
