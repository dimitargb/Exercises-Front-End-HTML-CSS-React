JSX is a Declerative syntax to describe what components look like and how they work!!!

Each component must return one block of JSX, which React wil then use to render the component on the web.

Components must return a block of JSX.

JSX is an extension of JS that allows us to embed JavaScript, CSS, and React components into HTML.

Each JSX element is converted to a React.createElement function call.

React use a Declerative approach to build websites, JS use Imperative approach.
Declerative is to discribe what the UI should look like always based ont the current data - props and State.

We use JSX to discribe the UI(User Interface), based on props and State !!!
React is abstraction away form DOM, we never touch the DOM.
Instead we think of the UI as a Reflection of the current data.

JSX combines HTML, CSS and JavaScript into one Single block of code !!!
