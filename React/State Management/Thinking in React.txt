Thinking in React menas: how and when to use components, state, props, general Data flow ect.

- It means thinking in State mutations, rather than elemnts mutaions.

Thinking in React is a process:

1. Break the disired UI into  components and how they are related to each other and establish the coponent tree.

2. Srating by building a static version of the application(without state).

3. Use State: - when to use State.
               - Types of State: local / global.
               - where to place each piece of State.
4. Data flow thrue the application:
 - one way data flow
 - form Child to Parent communication
 - accessing global State.

 3 and 4 is State Managments !!!
