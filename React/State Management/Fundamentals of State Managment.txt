We can use the useState() function to create multiple pices of State in order to track Data that changes over the
livecicle of of an application.

State Managment is the decision: when we need to create new pieces of State, what type of State we need,
where to place each piece of State and how the Data should flow through the application.

We give each pice of Sate a home in within our code.

Diffrence between global and local State in React.

Local State is only in one Component or a few diffrent Components.
We create Local State using the useState() function inside a certain Component.
That pice of State is only accessable to that exact Component and Child Component if we use Props.

Global State is a State where many diffrent Components might need access to.
This State will become accessable to every single Component in the entire application.
This Sate is called Shared State. It is shared between all Components.


When to create State and where to place it?
