Styling Options in React:

1. To apply inline CSS ot JSX elemnts using the style prop !!! - those are local styles only for this element.
2. External CSS file using the className prop!!! -  those are global styles only for all elements.

In professional Projects CSS is almost never global, becaouse it can bring huge problems in the App.
Instead CSS should be scoped in the individual Component.  Those are the CSS Modules!!!

3. CSS Modules. We write one CSS file for each of out Components. The styles in that file will then be scoped for
   only this Component, so no other Component can use them.

4. CSS in JavaScript Library. We actually write our CSS in a JS file. It allows us to create React Components,
    that have their styles direclty apllyed to them.

5. Utility-first CSS Framework called(tailwindcss). Here we use predefined utilty Classes to define 
    individual styles to use Flexbox, to make layout Responsive, to make hoover effects and to design the 
    intire UI.

6. You can use alternative to stylingwith CSS: UI Librarys like Matrial UI, Chakra UI, Mantine ect. Those Librarys
    contains all kinds of prebuild and prestyled Components that a common in most web applications.
