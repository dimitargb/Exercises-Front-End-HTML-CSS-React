JSX works like the HTML it has very sillimar syntax, we can enter JavaScript mode by using {}
any where were a value like text or attribute is expected.

Into this JavaScript mode we can place any JavaScript experssion like: variables, arrays, create objects, loop over arrays
using map(), trenary operator exetera.

What is not allowed are statemanets like: if/else, for, switch.

A piece of JSX produces a JavaScript expression:
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello React!');

Difetences wit HTML:
-className intead of class
-every tag needs to be closed
-all eventhandlers and other properties needs to be written in camelCase.
-CSS inline are written like this:{{<style}}
-CSS property names are also in camelCase
