Filter Method - filter some elements of the array based on the condition.

Lets say we want to create an array that has books woth more than 500 pages.
The filter function will be called for ech element of the array.

If the condition statement returns true(book.pages > 500) the array will go into the new Array longBooks!!!

const longBooks = books.filter((book) => book.pages > 500);

ont this array we can call another filer.
const longBooks = books.filter((book) => book.pages > 500)
                        .filter((book)=>book.hasMovieAdaptation);

 we can chain mulitple filters !!!
