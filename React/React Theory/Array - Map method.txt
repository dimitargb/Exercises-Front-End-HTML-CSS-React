Metods who do not mutate the original array - map, filter and reduce !!!

1. Map method:

The map method will loop over an Array and return a new Array with the same length wit some operation applied on each
of the elements of the original Array.

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map((el) => el * 2);
console.log(arr);

const titles = books.map((book) => book.title);
console.log(titles);

const essentialData = books.map((book) => ({
  title: book.title,
  author: book.author,
  reviewsCount: getTotalReviesCount(book),
}));
