State is an internal Data, data which is owned by the Component!!!

Props is an external Data, owned by Parent Component, where Parents can pass Data into Children!!!

State can be updated by the Component itself!!!

Updating State couses Component to re-render, which is used to make Component interactive!

Props are read-only, they can not be modified by the component that is recieving them!!!

When the Child Component recieves new updated Props, that couses the Component to re-render!!!

Props are used by Parent Components the abilty to configure their Child Components!!!
