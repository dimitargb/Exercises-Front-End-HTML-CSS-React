In React we do not manilpulate the DOM direcltly when we want to update the componenst view !!!
This is because React is declerative not imperative. We never touch the DOM in our code.

How is component view udated? - React updates a Component veiw by rerendering the etire Component.

When State is updated the Component is authomatically re-rendered.

When the eventHandler is clicked, this updates a pice of  State in out Component using the useState() function.
Than when React sees that the State has been changed it will automatically re-render the Component whuch will result
in an updatet View for this Component.

Whenever we want to update a Component view, we update it's State.

Reacts reacts on State changes by re-rendering the UI(User Interface)!!!

Frameworks exsitsts to keep the UI in sync with the Data.
