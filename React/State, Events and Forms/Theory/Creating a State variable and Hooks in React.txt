First we crate a state variable and to do that we use a useState Function.

import { useState } from "react";

useState() it takes a variable inside and that is the default value of the State variable.
In our application this is step 1. This function will return ana array. So:

const array = useState(1) , the second value in the useState is a function we can use to udate our state Variable.
so what we do we destructure the array -> const[step, setStep] - set and the name of the veriable = setStep.

const [step, setStep] = useState(1);

The last step is to actually update the state.

We use the setStep() to update the state Variable !!!

  function handleNext() {
    setStep(step + 1);
  }
So when we click the Next button the step should go one up.

The useState() function is a Hook in React !!!
We can identify Hooks because they start with use-Keyword -> useState is a Hook !!!

We should only udate the state in UI using the useState Function or Hook, but not manually!!!
