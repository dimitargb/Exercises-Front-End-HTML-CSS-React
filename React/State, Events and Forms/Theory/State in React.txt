In order to make a Component interactive we need State.

State is the most important concept in React !!!
We will learn what is State, what it does and why we need it.

State is the memory of the Component.
Exsamples are messages(6), notificatinsFiled(15) content of a shopping Cart(35$).

A piece of state/ state variable is a sigle variable in a Component state.

The general term state is all the pices of state together.

Updating State triggers React to rerender the Component !!!

When one single Component is rendered we called it a view!!
All the vies combined together make the final UI(User Interface)!!!

State is how React keeps the UI(User Interface) in sync with the Data !!!
We change the Sate we change the UI !!!

1. State allows us to update the Component view by rerendering the Component!

Mastering the State, will unlock the power of React Development !!!
