Each Component manages his own state.

If we change the State of one Component it will not effect the State ofthe other Components!!!

With the State we now view the UI as a reflection of Data changing over time!!

Practical GuideLines on how to use State:
1. You should create a new stateVariable for any Data that the Component should keep truck off over time!!

2.Whenever you want something in your Component to be dynamic, create a pice of State related to that thing, than
  update the State when the thing should change!

  For exsample create variable isOpen, if is true the window is open, when is false we hide it!

3.Udateing the State is happaning with the event Handler function.

4. For a data that will not re-render the Component, dont use State, use regular variable.
