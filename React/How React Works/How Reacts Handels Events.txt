Whenever a click(onClick) happends on the button, a new event Object is fired off which will travle down the DOM Tree
untill it reaches his target -> the button, from there the event wil bubble back up, 
than as soon as the event reaches the 'root'conatiner, where React regesters all the Handlers the Event will finally 
get handled. Once this is all done, the event continious to bubble up untill it disappears.
