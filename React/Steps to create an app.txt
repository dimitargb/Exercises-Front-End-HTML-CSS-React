The first file to create is index.js
The module exepects the entry point to be called index.js !!!

- import React from "react";
- import { ReactDOM } from "react-dom/client";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Wellcome to React Development !!!</h1>
      <Pizza />
      <Pizza />
    </div>
  );
}
 
// This is the way we render our App in the DOM in React version 18 and above.!!!
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);

// In StrictMode is like this:
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

Strict Mode during development will render our componensts twice in order to find certain bugs and also
React will check if we are using outdated parts of the React API

Creating a brand new component !!
