We want to set up a grid that contains 3 rows from the layout.
One row is for the Header.
Let make this a grid cointainer. In order to make a grid cointainer we use the grid class -> className="grid";

hight is h and value-> h-3

div className="grid h-[500px] bg-red-500 grid-rows-3"> (grid-rows-3)->разделяме на три реда 

grid-cols-2 -> 2 колони.
gap-4

grid h-screen -> will take the entire hight of the view Port : 

<div className="grid h-screen grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto]">

In order to scroll corectely even in smaller screens in Tailwind we use -> <main className="overflow-scroll">
This sets the overflow proerty to scroll, which means if there is now enough space it will force us to scroll.

We need to give the container a certain width-w.
In situations in which we want a fluid design we should always use max-width.
