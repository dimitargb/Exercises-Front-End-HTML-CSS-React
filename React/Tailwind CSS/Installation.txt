Install Tailwind CSS with Vite

Tailwind/installation/framework-guides - then vite

Open up a new Terminal and write:
1. npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer - в случея използваме версия 3, но може и само tailwindcss
2. npx tailwindcss init -p
3. Than in tailwind.config.js we need to put in the array following code:
    export default {
    content: [
        "./index.html",
        "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    ],
    theme: {
        extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
    }
4. Than add to index.css on the top -> 
    @import "tailwindcss/base";
    @import "tailwindcss/components";
    @import "tailwindcss/utilities";

There are 2 more things we need to do:
1. intsall vscode extention; type tailwind in the search bar in VS code and install Tailwind SCC InteliSense.

2. finally we need to install a special tailwind prettier extension.
   Copy this - npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss 
   open new terminal and paste it.

   This will automatically sort the order of the classNames in a way that tailwind recommends it.
