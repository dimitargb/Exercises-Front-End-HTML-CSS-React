There is a very handy class in Tailwind that we can use to separate lements on a page.
This class is called the divide class.
It will place a line between all the child elements in the menu.

function Menu() {
    const menu = useLoaderData()

    return (
        <ul>
            {menu.map((pizza) => (
                <MenuItem pizza={pizza} key={pizza.id} />
            ))}
        </ul>
    )
}

className="divide-y " -> divide and the direction y(vertical)
