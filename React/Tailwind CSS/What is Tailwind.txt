Tailwind is a utility first Framework packed with utility classes like flex, text-center and rotate 90 
that can be composed to build any design directly in your markup(HTML or jsx).

When we write a utility first CSS(atomic SCC) we write lots and lots of tiny classes, where each class has one single purpuse
and we then combine this classes to build entire components and lyaouts.

In tailwind all this tiny classes are alreday written for us ready to be used.
