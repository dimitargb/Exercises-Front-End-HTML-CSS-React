In order to load(fetch) data form an external API

The first way is directly use the concept of the promisses!

1.Using Promises in JavaScript
// we use a function fetch() - this is a Promis because we need to wait untill it gets the data from server
console.log(fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos"));

a) - Promiss can be pending if it is doing something in the background.
b) - Promiss can be rejected if there is an error ib fetching the data.
c) - Promiss can be rejected can be fullfilled, which means that the data has successfully arraived.

 we  can hendle the fullfiled State by using the then method!!!
 the then method will be called as soon as the promiss has been fullfilled!!!
 then the data after response needs to be converted form JSON to JS Object
 after converting it will return another promise, that's why we need to add another then with final data in JS form.

fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));a
